## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for RAG Chatbot implementation with 52 specific tasks organized across 7 phases:
1. Setup (T001-T005) - Project initialization
2. Foundational (T006-T017) - Core components
3. User Story 1 (T018-T025) - Basic Q&A functionality (P1 priority)
4. User Story 2 (T026-T031) - Selected text queries (P2 priority)
5. User Story 3 (T032-T039) - Conversation context (P2 priority)
6. User Story 4 (T040-T044) - Source information (P3 priority)
7. Polish (T045-T054) - Cross-cutting concerns

Tasks follow proper format with checkboxes, IDs, story labels, and file paths. MVP scope defined as User Story 1 (T001-T025). Parallel execution opportunities identified for efficient development.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created detailed task list with 52 specific, actionable tasks for RAG chatbot implementation
- 🧪 Tests: No tests yet - task generation phase
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with properly formatted tasks organized by user story
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation with `/sp.implement` or individual task execution
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story priority with clear dependencies and parallel opportunities

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
