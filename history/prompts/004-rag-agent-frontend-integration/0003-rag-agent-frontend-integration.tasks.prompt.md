## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for RAG Agent Frontend Integration feature with 40 specific, actionable tasks organized across 5 phases:

1. **Phase 1: Setup** (T001-T004) - Project initialization and foundational components
2. **Phase 2: User Story 1 (P1)** (T005-T015) - Core Q&A functionality with API integration and basic UI
3. **Phase 3: User Story 2 (P2)** (T016-T022) - Error handling and user feedback
4. **Phase 4: User Story 3 (P3)** (T023-T029) - UI refinements and accessibility
5. **Phase 5: Polish** (T030-T040) - Cross-cutting concerns and final testing

All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper Task IDs, story labels where appropriate, and specific file paths. Tasks are organized by user story priority to enable independent implementation and testing. Parallel execution opportunities are identified with [P] markers.

## Outcome
