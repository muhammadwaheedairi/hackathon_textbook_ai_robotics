# Search Feature User Guide

## Getting Started

The search feature is located at the top of every textbook page. Simply type your search term in the search bar and results will appear automatically as you type.

## How to Search

### Basic Search
1. Click on the search bar at the top of the page (or start typing to auto-focus)
2. Enter your search term (e.g., "robotics", "algorithm", "neural network")
3. Results will appear below the search bar as you type
4. Matching terms in the content will be highlighted in yellow

### Example Searches
- **Simple term**: Type "AI" to find all occurrences of artificial intelligence
- **Partial match**: Type "learn" to find "learning", "learner", "machine learning", etc.
- **Multi-word**: Type "machine learning" to find content containing both words

## Search Features

### Highlighting
When you search, matching terms in the content are highlighted with a yellow background. This makes it easy to spot relevant information on the page.

### Real-time Results
Results update automatically as you type with a slight delay (300ms) to ensure smooth performance. This means you don't need to press Enter or click a search button.

### Search Results Panel
The search results panel shows:
- Number of matches found
- Snippets of content containing your search term
- Links to jump directly to relevant sections

## Advanced Search Tips

### Case Sensitivity
The search is not case-sensitive, so "Robotics", "robotics", and "ROBOTICS" will all yield the same results.

### Partial Matching
The search automatically finds partial matches. For example:
- Searching for "robot" will find "robotics", "robots", "robotic", etc.
- Searching for "learn" will find "learning", "learner", "machine learning", etc.

### Special Characters
The search handles special characters properly. You can search for technical terms containing symbols like:
- "AI-based" or "AI_based"
- "3D-printing" or "3D printing"
- "C++" or "OOP"

## Navigation

### Using Search Results
1. Click on any result in the search panel to jump directly to that section
2. The target section will be highlighted and centered on the screen
3. A temporary highlight will show you the exact location

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Start typing anywhere on the page to focus the search bar
- Use `Escape` to close the search results panel
- Navigate results with mouse or touch

## Mobile Usage

On mobile devices:
- The search bar is fully responsive
- Results panel adapts to smaller screens
- Touch-friendly interface for navigation
- Same search capabilities as desktop

## Troubleshooting

### No Results Found
If you don't see any results:
- Check your spelling
- Try using fewer or different keywords
- Remember that search only covers the current page's content
- Try a broader search term (e.g., "system" instead of a very specific term)

### Highlights Not Visible
If highlights don't appear:
- Make sure your search term exists on the current page
- Refresh the page if needed
- Check that JavaScript is enabled in your browser

### Search Not Responding
If the search seems slow or unresponsive:
- Wait a moment for the debounce delay to complete
- Try a simpler search term
- Clear your browser cache if issues persist

## Accessibility

The search feature is designed with accessibility in mind:
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Proper ARIA labels
- Sufficient color contrast for highlights
- Clear focus indicators

## Limitations

### Content Scope
- Search only works on the current page
- Content loaded dynamically may not be indexed
- External links and embedded content are not searchable

### Query Limits
- Maximum query length: 200 characters
- Minimum query length: 1 character
- Queries with only whitespace are ignored

## Best Practices

### Effective Searching
- Use specific terms for precise results
- Use general terms for broader results
- Take advantage of partial matching
- Use multiple short searches instead of one complex query

### When to Search
- Looking for specific terms or concepts
- Finding information you remember reading
- Exploring related topics
- Reviewing content before an exam
